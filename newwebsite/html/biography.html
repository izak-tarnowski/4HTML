Tupac Shakur was murdered in a drive-by shooting on the night of September 7th, 1996, on East Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, NV.
He attended the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match at the MGM Grand with his entourage and Suge Knight. They spotted a rival gang member, who allegedly robbed a member of 
their record label and Tupac attacked him with his entourage. This lead to the rival member, Orlando Anderson or "Baby Lane", to be a prime suspect in the murder
of Tupac. They left the MGM Grand and made their way to a club that Suge Knight owned. On the way, they were stopped at traffic lights where a white
Cadillac pulled along side and started firing at the car that Tupac was in. He was hit 4 times, while Suge was only hit with fragmentation on the head.
6 days later, on September 13th 1996, Tupac was pronounced dead from the wounds he received during the shooting.
Lots of high-ranked rappers, including Biggie Smalls (before his death in 1997), Snoop Dogg, Eminem, the Outlawz and Bone Thugs n Harmony all mourned
Tupac. Multiple interviews with Biggie Smalls gave insight to how he felt about Tupac, despite their problems, they were always close.
