		<h2>Tupac Amaru Shakur</h2>
		Most popularly known by his stage name 2Pac, was an American rapper and actor.
		He is most known for his rapping career over his acting career. Most renown and probably most controversial was the 2Pacalypse Now album.
		This album featured tracks containing fairly violent lyrics against police brutality, notably the track "I Don't Give a F***", where the lyrics were targeted at police, correctional officers and other agencies.
		Other tracks from that album, were "Brenda's Got A Baby" and "If My Homie Calls" which received lots of positive criticism for their poetic value, as well as "Rebel Of The Underground".
